# A version of Memory in React

Watch the code deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://exilic.github.io/memory/).

## Game function

The user can reveal hidden images by mouse clicking on single colored cards. Each turn lets the user click two cards. The user aims to match a pair of identical images, of which there are only two. Identified pairs are subsequently removed from the board. The challenge is thus to keep the position of previously revealed images in memory. The game ends when all the cards are removed from the board. 

## Responsiveness

The game can be played on a smart phone, although designed for being played on a computer.
